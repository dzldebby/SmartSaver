Implement response validation
Verify financial advice is within reasonable parameters
Check for hallucinated information about banks or rates
Ensure responses match the user's question
Design response enhancement
Add formatting for financial figures
Insert relevant links to bank websites
Include visual elements (charts, tables) when appropriate
Edge Cases:
Incorrect financial advice: Implement guardrails for common misconceptions
Ambiguous user questions: Create clarification workflows
Responses that exceed display limits: Implement pagination
3. Session Management
Steps:
Design chat history storage
Create data structures for conversation history
Implement session persistence using Streamlit's session state
Design history truncation for long sessions
Implement context sharing between calculator and chat
Create bidirectional data flow between calculator inputs and chat context
Design update triggers when calculator values change
Implement context refreshing when new calculations are performed
Create user preference storage
Design system to remember user's preferred banks
Implement storage for frequently asked questions
Create mechanism to recall previous calculation parameters
Edge Cases:
Session timeout: Implement graceful recovery of conversation
Multiple calculations in one session: Maintain clear context about which results are being discussed
Browser refresh: Provide option to restore previous session
4. Suggestion Generation System
Steps:
Implement dynamic suggestion generation
Create rules engine to generate contextual suggestions
Design suggestion prioritization algorithm
Implement suggestion diversity to cover different question types
Create suggestion templates
Design template library for common questions
Implement parameter substitution for bank names, amounts, etc.
Create visual formatting for suggestion chips
Implement suggestion tracking
Create analytics to track which suggestions are used
Design feedback loop to improve suggestion relevance
Implement A/B testing framework for suggestion variants
Edge Cases:
No clear suggestions available: Implement fallback generic suggestions
Too many relevant suggestions: Create prioritization logic
Repeated suggestions: Implement variation to avoid repetition
Frontend Implementation
1. Chat UI Component
Steps:
Design chat panel component
Create expandable/collapsible container
Design message bubbles for user and AI
Implement typing indicators and loading states
Implement chat input system
Create text input with submit button
Design suggestion chips with proper styling
Implement keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send)
Create animation system
Design smooth entrance animation for post-calculation appearance
Implement subtle animations for new messages
Create minimize/maximize animations
Edge Cases:
Very long messages: Implement auto-scrolling and message truncation
Mobile view constraints: Create responsive design that works on small screens
Accessibility: Ensure screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation
2. Results Integration
Steps:
Modify calculation result display
Add container for chat panel below results
Implement smooth transition between results and chat
Design visual connection between results and chat
Create contextual highlighting
Implement system to highlight relevant parts of results when mentioned in chat
Design hover states for interactive elements
Create visual indicators for actionable advice
Implement action buttons in chat
Design buttons for recalculating with suggested changes
Create comparison view triggers from chat
Implement deep links to specific sections of the calculator
Edge Cases:
Limited screen space: Create collapsible sections
Multiple result sets: Implement clear visual separation
Print/export view: Design printer-friendly version that includes relevant chat insights
3. Responsive Design
Steps:
Implement desktop view
Design side-by-side layout for wider screens
Create optimal spacing for readability
Implement hover states and interactions
Create tablet view
Design responsive breakpoints
Implement collapsible sections
Create touch-friendly interaction targets
Optimize mobile view
Design stacked layout for narrow screens
Implement expandable/collapsible sections
Create thumb-friendly touch targets
Edge Cases:
Very small screens: Implement critical content prioritization
Landscape mobile orientation: Create optimized layout
Accessibility zoom: Ensure UI remains functional at high zoom levels
4. User Feedback System
Steps:
Implement response rating
Create thumbs up/down buttons for AI responses
Design feedback collection modal
Implement analytics tracking for response quality
Create suggestion improvement system
Design interface for users to suggest better responses
Implement feedback collection for unhelpful suggestions
Create admin review system for feedback
Implement continuous improvement loop
Design data collection for prompt improvement
Create analytics dashboard for chat performance
Implement A/B testing framework for UI variations
Edge Cases:
Negative feedback patterns: Create escalation for consistently poor responses
Abuse/misuse: Implement content moderation
Feature requests in feedback: Create categorization system
